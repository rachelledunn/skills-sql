-- 1. Select all columns for all brands in the Brands table.
SELECT * 
FROM Brands;

-- 2. Select all columns for all car models made by Pontiac in the Models table.
SELECT * 
FROM Models 
WHERE brand_name = 'Pontiac';

-- 3. Select the brand name and model 
--    name for all models made in 1964 from the Models table.
SELECT brand_name, name 
FROM Models 
WHERE year = '1964';

-- 4. Select the model name, brand name, and headquarters for the Ford Mustang 
--    from the Models and Brands tables.
SELECT Models.name, Models.brand_name, Brands.headquarters 
FROM Models JOIN Brands ON (Models.brand_name=Brands.name) 
WHERE Models.brand_name = 'Ford' 
AND Models.name = 'Mustang';

-- 5. Select all rows for the three oldest brands 
--    from the Brands table (Hint: you can use LIMIT and ORDER BY).
SELECT * 
FROM Brands 
ORDER BY founded 
LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Count the Ford models in the database (output should be a **number**).
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Models 
WHERE brand_name = 'Ford';

-- 7. Select the **name** of any and all car brands that are not discontinued.
SELECT name 
FROM Brands 
WHERE discontinued is NULL or discontinued = '';

-- 8. Select rows 15-25 of the DB in alphabetical order by model name.
SELECT * 
FROM Models 
ORDER BY name 
LIMIT 11 
    OFFSET 14;

-- 9. Select the **brand, name, and year the model's brand was 
--    founded** for all of the models from 1960. Include row(s)
--    for model(s) even if its brand is not in the Brands table.
--    (The year the brand was founded should be ``null`` if 
--    the brand is not in the Brands table.)
SELECT Models.brand_name, Models.name, Brands.founded 
FROM Models 
    LEFT JOIN Brands 
        ON (Models.brand_name=Brands.name) 
WHERE Models.year = '1960';

-- Part 2: Change the following queries according to the specifications. 
-- Include the answers to the follow up questions in a comment below your
-- query.

-- 1. Modify this query so it shows all **brands** that are not discontinued
-- regardless of whether they have any cars in the cars table.
-- before:
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        b.founded,
    --        m.name
    -- FROM Model AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;
SELECT b.name,
   b.founded,
   m.name
FROM Brands AS b
  LEFT JOIN Models AS m
    ON b.name = m.brand_name
WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;

-- 2. Modify this left join so it only selects models that have brands in the Brands table.
-- before: 
    -- SELECT m.name,
    --        m.brand_name,
    --        b.founded
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name;

SELECT m.name,
       m.brand_name,
       b.founded
FROM Models AS m
  LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    ON b.name = m.brand_name;

-- followup question: In your own words, describe the difference between 
-- left joins and inner joins.
-- Inner joins only select what overlaps for both tables, left joins select everything that is true from the first table, even if the value is null from the second table.

-- 3. Modify the query so that it only selects brands that don't have any car models in the cars table. 
-- (Hint: it should only show Tesla's row.)
-- before: 
    -- SELECT name,
    --        founded
    -- FROM Brands
    --   LEFT JOIN Models
    --     ON brands.name = Models.brand_name
    -- WHERE Models.year > 1940;

SELECT Brands.name,
       Brands.founded
FROM Brands
    LEFT JOIN Models
    ON Brands.name = Models.brand_name
WHERE Models.brand_name IS NULL AND Brands.name IS NOT NULL;

-- 4. Modify the query to add another column to the results to show 
-- the number of years from the year of the model *until* the brand becomes discontinued
-- Display this column with the name years_until_brand_discontinued.
-- before: 
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        m.name,
    --        m.year,
    --        b.discontinued
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON m.brand_name = b.name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL; 

SELECT b.name,
       m.name,
       m.year,
       b.discontinued, 
       (b.discontinued - m.year) AS years_until_brand_discontinued
FROM Models AS m
  LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    ON m.brand_name = b.name
WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;

-- Part 3: Futher Study

-- 1. Select the **name** of any brand with more than 5 models in the database.
SELECT Brands.name 
FROM Brands
    JOIN Models
        ON Brands.name = Models.brand_name
GROUP BY Models.brand_name
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- 2. Add the following rows to the Models table.

-- year    brand_name   name
-- ----    ----         ----------
-- 2015    Chevrolet    Malibu
-- 2015    Subaru       Outback
INSERT INTO Models (year, brand_name, name)
    VALUES (2015, 'Chevrolet', 'Malibu');

INSERT INTO Models (year, brand_name, name)
    VALUES (2015, 'Subaru', 'Outback');

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to crate a table called ``Awards`` 
--    with columns ``name``, ``year``, and ``winner``. Choose 
--    an appropriate datatype and nullability for each column.
CREATE TABLE Awards(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    year INT(4) NOT NULL,
    winner VARCHAR(30)
    );

-- 4. Write a SQL statement that adds the following rows to the Awards table:

--   name                 year      winner_model_id
--   ----                 ----      ---------------
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      # get the ``id`` of the 2015 Subaru Outback
INSERT INTO Awards (name, year, winner)
    VALUES ('IIHS Safety Award', 2015, (SELECT id FROM Models WHERE year = 2015 AND brand_name = 'Chevrolet' AND name = 'Malibu'));

INSERT INTO Awards (name, year, winner)
    VALUES ('IIHS Safety Award', 2015, (SELECT id FROM Models WHERE year = 2015 AND brand_name = 'Subaru' AND name = 'Outback'));

-- 5. Using a subquery, select only the *name* of any model whose 
-- year is the same year that *any* brand was founded.
SELECT m.name 
FROM Models as m
WHERE (SELECT year FROM Models) != (SELECT founded FROM Brands);
